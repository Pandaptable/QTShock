# TF2 [QTShock](https://qtshock.com) integration
Shocks you on crit death and normal death (both configuarable)

(i also have it beeping on kill but you can change that if you edit `main.py`)

# Setup
### Requirements
* Python (recommended is 3.11.9 as that's what I use)
* A (half) functioning brain
* A little bit of time

### Setup
Put `-condebug -conclearlog +con_timestamp 1` inside of your launch options for TF2 by going to properties and pasting them in the box

Make a copy of `config_default.py`, name it `config.py` and modify it to your liking.

Launch the program by running `python main.py` inside of a terminal next to the script, and you can launch your game! (order does not matter)

Note: You can exit the program with ctrl + c
